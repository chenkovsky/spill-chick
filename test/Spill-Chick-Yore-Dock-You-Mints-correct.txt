Dear Mrs. Spellbound:

You might have used some spell checker which came with your computer. It's great at putting marks for all to find mistakes I cannot see. I done put your lines right through by typing so carefully. It's going to be perfect and I know it's going to be because our computer told me and you and everybody around here so.

Sincerely,

Thomas Jackson
