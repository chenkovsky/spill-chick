I have a spelling checker
It came with my PC
It plainly marks for my review
Mistakes I cannot see

I strike a key and type a word
And wait for it to say
Whether I am wrong or right
It shows me straight away

As soon as a mistake is made
It knows before too long
And I can put the error right
It’s rarely ever wrong

I have run this poem through it
I am sure you’re pleased to know
It’s letter perfect in its way
My checker told me so
