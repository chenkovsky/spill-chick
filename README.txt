spill-chick is a language entropy fighter.

There are all sorts of typing errors one can make.
Most cannot be caught with dictionary-based checkers and hard-coded grammar checkers.

Some examples:
	misspelling producing a valid word .......... I hop my code works
	word merging/splitting ...................... always miss spelling stuff
	phonetic mix-up ............................. nobody likes miss steaks
	botched idioms .............................. for all intensive purposes
	word omission ............................... oops, I the word
	inconsistency of proper nouns ............... Julius Seizure
