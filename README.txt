spill-chick is a context-sensitive spelling/grammar/language checker designed
to recognize spelling and grammar errors which pass existing checkers but
result in bogus text.

There are all sorts of typing errors one can make.

	transcription error .................... speling is hard
	homophone error ........................ peace of crap
	transposition error .................... causal Friday
	grammatical error ...................... your right!
	word merging/splitting ................. always miss spelling stuff
	botched idioms ......................... for all intensive purposes
	word omission .......................... oops, I the word
	inconsistency of proper nouns .......... Julius Seizure

It is inspired by 'Ode To My Spell Checker', which contains no spelling
errors, is perfectly readable and yet is very incorrect. It begins:

	Eye halve a spelling chequer
	It came with my pea sea
	It plainly marques four my revue
	Miss steaks eye kin knot sea.
