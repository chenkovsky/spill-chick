spill-chick is a statistical spelling/grammar/idiom entropy fighter.

There are all sorts of typing errors one can make.

Most cannot be caught with hard-coded dictionaries and grammer checkers.

Some examples:
	misspelling producing a valid word .......... I hop my cod works
	word merging/splitting ...................... always miss spelling stuff
	phonetic mix-up ............................. nobody likes miss steaks
	word omission ............................... oops, I the word
	botched idioms .............................. for all intensive purposes
	inconsistency of proper nouns ............... Julius Seizure
