spill-chick is a context-sensitive language checker designed to
correct spelling and grammar errors which pass existing checkers.

There are all sorts of typing errors one can make.

	transcription error .................... speling is hard
	transposition error .................... causal Friday
	homophone error ........................ peace of crap
	grammatical error ...................... your right!
	word merging/splitting ................. always miss spelling stuff
	botched idioms ......................... for all intensive purposes
	word omission .......................... oops, I the word
	word duplication ....................... and it does does also
	inconsistency of proper nouns .......... Julius Seizure

It is inspired by 'Ode To My Spell Checker', which contains no spelling
errors, is perfectly readable and yet is very incorrect. It begins:

	Eye halve a spelling chequer
	It came with my pea sea
	It plainly marques four my revue
	Miss steaks eye kin knot sea.

Progress:
	I have a spelling checker
	It came with my pc
	It plainly marks for my review
	Mistakes i did not see.
