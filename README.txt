spill-chick is a statistical spelling/grammar checker inspired by
'Ode To My Spell Checker'.

There are all sorts of typing errors one can make.

Most cannot be caught with traditional spelling/grammar checkers.

Some examples:
	misspelling producing a valid word ..... I hop my code works
	word merging/splitting ................. always miss spelling stuff
	phonetic mix-up ........................ nobody likes miss steaks
	botched idioms ......................... for all intensive purposes
	word omission .......................... oops, I the word
	inconsistency of proper nouns .......... Julius Seizure

Requirements: python3
